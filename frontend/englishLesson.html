        <h2>Basic Grammar Rules</h2>
        <h4>20 Grammar Rules</h4>
        <p>Here are 20 simple rules and tips to help you avoid mistakes in English grammar.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>1. A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period/full stop,<br> a question mark or an exclamation mark.</p>
        <p>2. The order of a basic positive sentence is Subject-Verb-Object.<br> (Negative and question sentences may have a different order.)</p>
        <p>3. Every sentence must have a subject and a verb. An object is optional.<br>
             Note that an imperative sentence may have a verb only,<br> but the subject is understood.</p>
        <p>4. The subject and verb must agree in number, that is a singular subject<br> needs a singular verb and a plural subject needs a plural verb.</p>
        <p>5. When two singular subjects are connected by or, use a singular verb. <br>The same is true for either/or and neither/nor.</p>
        <p>6. Adjectives usually come before a noun (except when a verb separates the adjective from the noun).</p>
        <p>7. When using two or more adjectives together, the usual order is opinion-adjective + fact-adjective + noun.<br> 
            (There are some additional rules for the order of fact adjectives.)</p>
        <p>8. Treat collective nouns (e.g. committee, company, board of directors) as singular OR plural.<br> 
            In BrE a collective noun is usually treated as plural, needing a plural verb and pronoun.<br>
             In AmE a collective noun is often treated as singular, needing a singular verb and pronoun.
             <li>The committee are having sandwiches for lunch. Then they will go to London. (typically BrE)</li>
                <li>The BBC have changed their logo. (typically BrE)</li>
                <li>My family likes going to the zoo. (typically AmE)</li>
                <li>CNN has changed its logo. (typically AmE)</li>
        </p>
        <p>9. The words its and it's are two different words with different meanings.
        <li>The dog has hurt its leg.</li>
        <li>He says it's two o'clock.</li>
    </p>
        <p>10. The words your and you're are two different words with different meanings.
            <li>Here is your coffee.</li>
            <li>You're looking good.</li>
        </p>
        <p>11. The words there, their and they're are three different words with different meanings
            <li>There was nobody at the party.</li>
            <li>I saw their new car.</li>
            <li>Do you think they're happy?</li>
        </p>
        <p>12. The contraction he's can mean he is OR he has. Similarly, she's can mean she is OR she has,<br>  
            and it's can mean it is OR it has</p>
        <p>13. The contraction he'd can mean he had OR he would. Similarly, they'd <br>
            can mean they had OR they would.</p>
        <p>14. Spell a proper noun with an initial capital letter. A proper noun is a "name"<br> 
            of something, for example Josef</p>
        <p>15. Spell proper adjectives with an initial capital letter. Proper adjectives are <br>
            made from proper nouns, for example Germany â†’ German</p>
        <p>16. Use the indefinite article a/an for countable nouns in general.<br>
         Use the definite article the for specific countable nouns and all uncountable nouns.</p>
        <p>17. Use the indefinite article a with words beginning with a consonant sound.<br>
             Use the indefinite article an with words beginning with a vowel sound. </p>
        <p>18. Use many or few with countable nouns. Use much/a lot or little for uncountable nouns.</p>
        <p>19. To show possession (who is the owner of something) use an apostrophe + s for singular owners,<br>
             and s + apostrophe for plural owners.
        </p>
        <p>20. In general, use the active voice (Cats eat fish) in preference <br>
            to the passive voice (Fish are eaten by cats).</p>
