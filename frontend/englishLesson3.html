        <h4>Nouns</h4>
          <p>
            What are nouns?
            <li>A noun is a word that identifies a person, place or a thing</li>
          </p>
          <p>Nouns can be either countable or uncountable</p>
          <li>Countable nouns can be plural or singular</li>
          <li>We use uncountable nouns for things we can't count such as air</li>
          <p>How to use nouns</p>
          <li>Use a or an with countable nouns in positive sentences<br>
          eg. We don't want a test.<br>
            I can see an ant.
          </li>
          <li>Use some with uncountable nouns in positive sentences<br>
          eg. She needs some glue.</li>
            <li>Use any before plural nouns and uncountable nouns in negative sentences and questions<br>
            eg. I haven't got any oranges. Are there any pears?<br>
            There isn't any glue. Have you got any paper?</li>
            <li>Use is or isn't with singular nouns and uncountable nouns.
              <br>
              eg. There's a house but there isn't a garden. Is there a garage?</li>
              <li>
                Use are or aren't with plural nouns.<br>
                eg. There are some sandwiches but there aren't any cakes. Are there any grapes?
              </li>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Pronouns</h4>
        <p>
          What are pronouns?
          <li>Pronouns are small words that take the place of a noun. We can use a pronoun instead of a noun</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use pronouns to replace the names of people and things.
<li>
  eg. My sister isn't here. She is at the park.<br>
My brother and I go to the same school. We like the teachers.<br>
My favourite books are old but they are really interesting.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          Use I, you, he, she, it, we or they.
          <li>
            eg. I'm from Mexico. You're from France.<br>
            He/She/It isn't here.<br>
            We/They are at home.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          Use it for the weather and the time.
          <li>
            eg. It's cold and raining.<br>
            Is it 5 o'clock yet?
          </li>
